create another table to store normalized temperature and precipitation data:
-- ID field must match some STATION table ID
(so name and location will be known).
-- allowable ranges will be enforced for other values.
-- no duplicate ID and MONTH combinations.
-- temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit.
-- rainfall is in inches.

CREATE TABLE STATS
(ID INTEGER REFERENCES STATION(ID),
MONTH INTEGER CHECK (MONTH BETWEEN 1 AND 12),
TEMP_F REAL CHECK (TEMP_F BETWEEN -80 AND 150),
RAIN_I REAL CHECK (RAIN_I BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
PRIMARY KEY (ID, MONTH));

populate the table STATS with some statistics for January and July:

INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13, 1, 57.4, 0.31);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13, 7, 91.7, 5.15);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44, 1, 27.3, 0.18);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44, 7, 74.8, 2.11);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66, 1, 6.7, 2.10);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66, 7, 65.8, 4.52);
